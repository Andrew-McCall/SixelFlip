# SixelFlip

## Description
### Project
My goal was to make a card pairing game using BBC Basic. For my code to be compatible with my hardware it must use less than 16kb of ram so Mode 7 was choosen. This was my first interaction with teletext and so I used "Sixel"s to create higher resolution graphics cheaply. This code could be easily made into asembly but basic was my aim. There is room for performance improvments but readability was a priority since I will be using this for educational purposes.
### Usage
**SixelFlip.bas is the source-code. This file is in plain text.**

SixelFlip.bbc can be ran in SDLIDE (1.35a was used for devlopment).  
SixelFlip.zip holds a windows executable which will play the game instead (Generated by SDLIDE).

WASD or Arrow keys, move the cursor*. 
Space, reveals a hidden card.
R, Restarts the game once all pairs have been found.
The highlighted name in the bottom shows the current player.
*Cursor is the checkered line above and below a card. It's colour is random and irrelevant

The frames alternate every second during the whole game.
There are also two sound effects. One for a correct pair and one for an incorrect match.
